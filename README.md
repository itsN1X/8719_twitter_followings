‚òÄ This project is a fork-off of the much simpler [`/itsN1X/`8678_twitter_followings](https://github.com/itsN1X/8678_twitter_followings) codebase. What follows is the legacy `README` from the aforementioned repository code. For instructions specific to this version, consider reading the `README` file after the triple linebreak.

# 8678_twitter_followings
Just a small Data Mining episode lmao ‚úÅ
###### oki oki jk jk
## What is this? `(itsN1X / 8678_twitter_followings)`
It is a half-attempt to get all the people I followed on twitter into a "Twitter""List".
### What this is 'not':
- It is not an automation.
- It is not a Node.js example/script/app/Ramen.
### Requirements
- [x] Your "Twitter Data"
Request it from [here](https://twitter.com/settings/)
- [x] Your favourite Text Editor
(mine is `ed` or `Pencil-on-Paper`:)
- [x] A browser!
(Please note: JavaScript is needed \\ enabled)
  - and ·äí[TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck,twitter.com)

## ·äí How to get this done?
- Get your archive.
- Navigate (`cd`) into `/data`.
- Edit the `following.js` to rename `window.YTD.following.part0`
(beginning with a letter, and no punctuations. KISS)
- Now, clone this repository locally.
(Or into the `/data` directory with the `following.js` file!)
- \[Optional\] Copy your `following.js` file where you cloned our repository.
- **Finally**, open the `viola.html` file.
Viola! There you a have a long list, separated by a line after 100 numbers!

### Next : Into the tweetdeck!
- Log into TweetDeck
- Make a new "Coloumn" containing the 'List' you want.
- Now, go to the coloumn settings.
- Select "Edit List".
- Tap on the icon next to "Add members".
- When you see an input box, simply paste the numbers from above steps!
**(Maximum 100 numbers at once)**
### What are these numbers?
These numbers are nothing bit the "Twitter's 'AccountId' for each user". So, its basically a unique identifier for each user. Therefore, it makes any 'change in usernames' or "screenname" immaterial. (Since an account follows an 'AccountId' and not an "@username" in the backend systems;)

## Thanks !

# [`/itsN1X/`8719_twitter_followings/](https://github.com/itsN1X/8719_twitter_followings)

This is an advanced version of [`/itsN1X/`8678_twitter_followings](https://github.com/itsN1X/8678_twitter_followings) codebase.
## What does it do?
This version is aimed at finding ~~friends~~ non-friends. Twitter defines friends as the two accounts mutually following each other.  
This piece of software lets you find **your** ~~friends~~non-friends.
### Requirements:
 - Your `followers.js`
 - Your `following.js`

### Results:
In the end, you will be handed over a list of `AccountId`s that can be imported into a twitter list via something like ***TweetDeck*** or something something.  
The file you shoot up this time is called the `heartbreak.html`.  All other steps are same as the previous versions.
